Practice project for implementing the same Pomodoro app using different tech stacks.

Frontend:
- [React](web-react/README.md)

Backend:
- [.NET](backend-dotnet/README.md)

## Versioning

For version changelog see the sub projects as they have their own versioning

Versions sharing the Major version should work with each other, meaning `web-react-1.2.0` should work with `backend-dotnet-1.9.3`

HOWEVER until the Major version reaches v1 treat Minor versions as Breaking Changes too.
